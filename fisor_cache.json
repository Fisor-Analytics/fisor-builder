    "query": "What were the housing affordability metrics in Toronto for 2022?",
    "snippet": "In 2022, housing affordability in Toronto was notably strained, marked by record-high ownership costs and significant price increases that made purchasing homes increasingly difficult for many households.\n\n## Key Housing Affordability Metrics for Toronto in 2022\n\n- **Mortgage Payment as a Percentage of Income (MPPI):**  \n  In the second quarter of 2022, the MPPI in the Greater Toronto Area (GTA) reached a record high of 91.0%, meaning the median household would need to spend 91% of their income on mortgage payments to afford a typical home. This was a 15.4 percentage point increase from the previous quarter and well above the 20-year average of 50.0% for Toronto[5]. By the third quarter of 2022, the MPPI remained extremely high at 85.2%, still among the worst affordability levels recorded[9].\n\n- **Home Prices:**  \n  The median home price in Toronto rose significantly, from approximately $1,075,636 in 2021 to about $1,257,257 in 2022, representing a year-over-year increase of 16.88%[6][8]. This price escalation contributed heavily to worsening affordability.\n\n- **Income and Downpayment:**  \n  The qualifying annual income needed to afford a home in Toronto was around $186,588, with a median household income of approximately $94,316, highlighting a substantial gap between income and housing costs[2]. The downpayment required was very high, with estimates around $236,114, equating to over 282 months of saving based on average incomes[2].\n\n- **Rental Market Context:**  \n  Average market rents also increased, putting additional pressure on affordability. For example, average rents for one-bedroom apartments in Toronto increased by 46% between 2013 and 2022, further exacerbating housing cost burdens for renters[7].\n\n- **Affordability Trends and Outlook:**  \n  RBC's housing affordability measures indicated that Toronto, along with Vancouver and Victoria, experienced some of the most severe affordability challenges in Canada in 2022, with ownership costs reaching near-impossible levels for many buyers. The rapid price escalation combined with rising interest rates (Bank of Canada rate hikes) pushed ownership costs to historic highs[1][9]. The outlook at the time suggested that affordability would worsen before any relief could come from expected price corrections and stabilization of interest rates[1][9].\n\n- **Housing Cost Burden:**  \n  Nearly one-third of Toronto households were spending over 30% of their income on housing costs, with renters more likely to face affordability challenges than owners. Severe unaffordability was particularly pronounced among low- and moderate-income households and racialized populations[7].\n\n## Summary\n\nIn 2022, Toronto's housing affordability was at a critical low point:\n\n- MPPI peaked at record levels around 85-91%, far exceeding historical averages.\n- Median home prices surged by nearly 17% year-over-year, surpassing $1.25 million.\n- Required incomes and downpayments were significantly higher than median household incomes.\n- Rising rents compounded affordability issues for many residents.\n- The combination of soaring prices and rising interest rates created the worst affordability conditions in decades, with many households spending a disproportionate share of income on housing.\n\nThese metrics illustrate the severe housing affordability crisis Toronto faced in 2022, impacting both potential homebuyers and renters alike[1][2][5][6][7][9].",

    "query": "Mortgage rates in Toronto during 2022",
    "snippet": "In 2022, mortgage rates in Toronto experienced significant changes, primarily due to the Bank of Canada's interest rate adjustments. Here's an overview of the key developments:\n\n1. **Interest Rate Increases**: The Bank of Canada began raising interest rates in March 2022 to combat inflation. This led to higher mortgage rates throughout the year. By the end of 2022, the 5-year conventional mortgage lending rate had reached 5.75% in October[4].\n\n2. **Impact on Housing Market**: The increase in interest rates affected the housing market by reducing demand and causing home prices to stabilize or decrease slightly. However, Toronto's housing market remained strong, with average new mortgage loan values peaking at $567,448 in Q3 2022[1].\n\n3. **Mortgage Payments**: As rates rose, so did monthly mortgage payments. The average monthly mortgage payment in Toronto increased throughout 2022, reflecting the higher interest rates and larger loan amounts[1].\n\n4. **Variable vs. Fixed Rates**: Variable mortgage rates were directly influenced by the Bank of Canada's prime rate changes, while fixed rates were more closely tied to bond yields. Both types of rates increased in 2022 due to economic conditions[7].\n\nOverall, 2022 was marked by rising mortgage rates and their impact on Toronto's housing market, with both fixed and variable rates increasing significantly over the year.",
